## Overview

The Contract resource usage is limited to representing persons that are authorized to view patient data. The subject of the contract is the patient that is the target of this authorization. The actors on the contract are the related people that are authorized to view data. An example would be where a contract represents that a mother is authorized to view her children's data. The contract is that authorization in FHIR.

Notes: 

- Either the `_id` or one of `actor`, `actor.identifier`, `patient.identifier`, or `subject` parameters must be provided.
- The `actor`, `actor.identifier`, `patient.identifier`, or `subject` parameters may be provided exactly once and may have only a single value.
- The `_include` parameter may be provided once for each resource to be included. Example: `_include=Contract:actor&_include=Contract:patient`
- Additional OAuth2 scopes are required when the `_include` parameter is provided. To include with `Contract:actor` or `Contract:patient` values, the OAuth2 token must include scopes for one or both RelatedPerson.read and Patient.read, respectively, depending on the combination of resources to be included.
