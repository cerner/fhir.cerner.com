## Overview

The StructureDefinition resource describes a FHIR structure including data elements and their usage. Our current implementation uses this resource to define custom extensions.

The following fields are returned if valued:

* [Id](http://hl7.org/fhir/r4/resource-definitions.html#Resource.id){:target="_blank"}
* [URL](http://hl7.org/fhir/r4/structuredefinition-definitions.html#StructureDefinition.url){:target="_blank"}
* [Name](http://hl7.org/fhir/r4/structuredefinition-definitions.html#StructureDefinition.name){:target="_blank"}
* [Title](http://hl7.org/fhir/r4/structuredefinition-definitions.html#StructureDefinition.title){:target="_blank"}
* [Status](http://hl7.org/fhir/r4/structuredefinition-definitions.html#StructureDefinition.status){:target="_blank"}
* [Date](http://hl7.org/fhir/r4/structuredefinition-definitions.html#StructureDefinition.date){:target="_blank"}
* [Publisher](http://hl7.org/fhir/r4/structuredefinition-definitions.html#StructureDefinition.publisher){:target="_blank"}
* [Description](http://hl7.org/fhir/r4/structuredefinition-definitions.html#StructureDefinition.description){:target="_blank"}

## Retrieve by id

List an individual StructureDefinition by its id:

    GET /StructureDefinition/:id

_Implementation Notes_

* Authentication is not required to access the StructureDefinition resource
* This resource can be retrieved by its defining URL or from the StructureDefinition resource located at the [service root URL](../../#service-root-url). For example, both of these URLs work:

    `https://fhir-ehr.cerner.com/r4/StructureDefinition/account-balance`

    `https://fhir-open.cerner.com/r4/ec2458f2-1e24-41c8-b71b-0e701af7583d/StructureDefinition/account-balance`

### Authorization Types

Authorization is not required.

<%= authorization_types(provider: true, patient: true, system: true) %>

### Headers

<%= headers head: {Accept: 'application/fhir+json'} %>

### Example


#### Request

    GET https://fhir-ehr.cerner.com/r4/StructureDefinition/account-balance

#### Response

<%= headers status: 200 %>
<%= json(:r4_structure_definition_bundle) %>
