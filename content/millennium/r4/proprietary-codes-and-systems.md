## Proprietary Codes

### Overview

Cerner's implementation of the HL7<sup>®</sup> R4 FHIR<sup>®</sup> standard allows Millennium proprietary code values to be used in addition to standard value set codes. This allows developers to read and write data with clients' proprietary codes, eliminating the need to map proprietary codes to standard codes. This is particularly beneficial for concepts that are highly customized by clients such as appointment and document types.

Millennium groups repetitive textual information into code sets. The code set stores a numeric code value that represents a textual or character display. Code sets are consistent across all clients. But the values in a code set vary between clients and are only guaranteed unique within a specific EHR system, which is the reason for the EHR source id (or tenant) qualifier in the system URL.

The following are true for all Millennium proprietary codes:

* The `system` value uses the following format: `https://fhir.cerner.com/<EHR source id>/codeSet/<code set>`
* The `code` value is the numeric code value as a string
* The `display` value is the code value display
* The `userSelected` value is set to true
* On inbound requests (POST, PUT, PATCH), proprietary codes and standard codes may not be set in the same coding array. If they are, the create or update request will fail with a `422 Unprocessable Entity` response.

Example outbound CodeableConcept displaying both standard and proprietary codes:

    {
      "type": {
        "coding": [
          {
            "system": "http://snomed.info/sct",

            "display": "Community medicine",

          },

            "code": "21265426",
            "display": "Same Day",
            "userSelected": true
          }
