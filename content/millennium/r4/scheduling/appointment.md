## Overview

The Appointment resource provides the ability to retrieve information about appointments, write new appointments, and update the status of existing appointments.

Date is required when searching by patient, practitioner, or location.

When integrating your application with a clientâ€™s production environment you will work with the client to determine the Practitioner and Location ids (Millennium personnel and location codes, respectively) which they want to make available to third-party applications for enabling scheduling functionality.

The status of arrived does not change the state of the millennium appointment but instead updates the patient tracking status to a value of Arrived.

R4 exposes a native checked-in status which allows for an appointment to transition from the booked state to the checked-in state. This is a change from the DSTU2 value mapping.

When updating an appointment, the resource provides the ability to change the [Appointment.status] in the following sequences:

* From Proposed to Booked, or Cancelled
* From Booked to Arrived, Checked-In, or Cancelled
* From Arrived to Checked-In, or Cancelled
* From Checked-In to Fulfilled, or Cancelled

Video Visit functionality is available for supported vendors only, and requires additional configuration and application support.

The following fields are returned if valued:

* [Appointment id](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/resource-definitions.html#Resource.id){:target="_blank"}
* [Status](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/appointment-definitions.html#Appointment.status){:target="_blank"}

### Authorization Types

<%= authorization_types(provider: true, system: true) %>

### Parameters

 Name           | Required?                                                | Type          | Description
----------------|----------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 `_id`          | Yes, or one of `patient`, `practitioner`, or `location`. | [`token`]     | The logical resource id associated with the Appointment. Example: `7890`
 `date`         | Yes when using `patient`, `practitioner`, or `location`. | [`date`]      | The Appointment date time with offset. Example: `2019-06-07T22:22:16.270Z`
 `patient`      | Yes, or `_id`                                            | [`reference`] | A single or comma separated list of Patient references. Example: `1234`
 `practitioner` | Yes, or `_id`                                            | [`reference`] | A single or comma separated list of Practitioner references. Example: `4567`
 `location`     | Yes, or `_id`                                            | [`reference`] | A single or comma separated list of Location references. Example: `6789`
 `status`       | No                                                       | [`token`]     | A single or comma separated list of appointment statuses. Example: `arrived`

Notes:

* The `patient`, `practitioner`, and `location` parameters may be included only once and may not be used in combination. For example, `patient=1234,5678` is supported but `patient=1234&patient=5678` and `patient=1234&location=5678` are not.
* The `date` parameter may be provided:
  * once with a prefix and time component to indicate a specific date/time. (e.g. `&date=ge2019-12-07T22:22:16.270Z`, `&date=lt2019-12-14T22:22:16.270Z`)
  * twice with the prefixes `ge` and `lt` to indicate a specific range. The date and prefix pairs must define an upper and lower bound. (e.g. `&date=ge2019-12-07T22:22:16.270Z&date=lt2019-12-14T22:22:16.270Z`)
* The retrieved appointments are sorted first by `start` date ascending (earliest first), followed by the provided search parameter (`patient`, `practitioner` or `location`) and `start` time ascending (earliest first).
