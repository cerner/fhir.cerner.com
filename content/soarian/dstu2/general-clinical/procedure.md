title: Procedure | Soarian DSTU 2 API

# Procedure

* TOC
{:toc}

## Overview

The API returns procedures charted in Soarian Clinicals. Procedures in completed or aborted status are returned; procedures in erroneous status are not returned. Note that traditional charting practices have procedures resolved and charted in coding and billing systems and not interfaced back to the EMR; therefore, the procedure record in Soarian may not be complete nor precise to a procedure list provided as part of a patient's billing record.

## Terminology Bindings

<%= terminology_table(:soarian_procedure, :dstu2) %>

## Custom Extensions

The [bundle extension] can be returned, see possible codes in the [errors section] below.

## Search

    GET /Procedure?:parameters

_Implementation Notes_

* The API returns the most current procedure list.
* The API returns procedures in a `completed` or `aborted` status. It will not return procedures marked as `entered-in-error`.
* The Narrative includes additional information pertaining to the procedures, and should be shown to the user to ensure completeness of clinical content and context.

### Parameters

 Name      | Required? | Type                                          | Description

* If the date parameter is null in the query, the API will return all qualifying records.
* If a single date parameter is used in the query, the response will include all qualifying records dated that day.
* If a valid date range is used in the query, the API will return all qualifying records within the dates specified.
* If an invalid date range is used in the query, the API will error with code [500][common-errors]. Please refer to [Special information regarding date parameters][date-parameter].
