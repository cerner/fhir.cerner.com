## Overview

The Encounter resource provides admissions or visits during which health care services were provided to a patient. An encounter has a class to distinguish between different health care settings such as inpatient, outpatient, emergency, and so on.

Soarian Clinicals<sup>®</sup> supports a read-only Application Programming Interface (API). This API accepts `GET` and `POST` based [search] and `GET` based [read] interactions. The response represents the most current information about the patient that is charted in Soarian Clinicals<sup>®</sup> at the time of the query. 

The search results include the following fields if they contain values:

* [Encounter id](https://hl7.org/fhir/r4/encounter-definitions.html#Encounter.id){:target="_blank"}

 Notes

* The `date` parameter may be provided up to two times, and must use the `eq`, `ge`, `gt`, `le`, or `lt` prefixes. When a value is provided without a prefix, an implied `eq` prefix is used. When provided twice, the lower value must have a `ge` or `gt` prefix and the higher value must have an `le` or `lt` prefix.
* The `_revinclude` parameter may be provided once with the value `Provenance:target`. Example: `_revinclude=Provenance:target`
* When `_revinclude` is provided in a request, the OAuth2 token must include the `patient/Provenance.read  system/Provenance.read`  or  `user/Provenance.read` scope as applicable.
