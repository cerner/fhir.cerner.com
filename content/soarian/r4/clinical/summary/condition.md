## Overview

The Condition resource represents problems, diagnoses, and health concerns. Problems are either ongoing conditions not associated with a specific encounter or point-in-time conditions recorded in the context of an encounter. Diagnoses are point-in-time conditions recorded in the context of an encounter. Health concerns represent other health issues or situations that may require ongoing monitoring or management, such as financial or social risks.

Soarian Clinicals<sup>®</sup> supports a read-only Application Programming Interface (API). This API accepts `GET` and `POST` based [search] and `GET` based [read] interactions. The response represents the most current information about the patient that is charted in Soarian Clinicals<sup>®</sup> at the time of the query.

The search results include the following fields if they contain values:

* [Condition Id](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/resource-definitions.html#Resource.id){:target="_blank"}
* [Status](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/condition-definitions.html#Condition.clinicalStatus){:target="_blank"}
* [Verification Status](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/condition-definitions.html#Condition.verificationStatus){:target="_blank"}
* [Category](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/condition-definitions.html#Condition.category){:target="_blank"}
* [Code](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/condition-definitions.html#Condition.code){:target="_blank"}
* [Subject](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/condition-definitions.html#Condition.subject){:target="_blank"}
* [Encounter](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/condition-definitions.html#Condition.encounter){:target="_blank"}
