# Binary

* TOC
{:toc}

## Overview

The Binary resource contains the actual data content of a single consolidated clinical document architecture (C-CDA)  Summary of Episode Note (SOEN) document. The Binary resource is the target of the DocumentReference.content.attachment.url element and the content is always XML.

Cerner recommends that you request a Binary resource only after obtaining the link to the resource using the reference made in DocumentReference. Cerner does not recommend starting a workflow with a Binary resource.

Soarian Clinicals<sup>®</sup> supports a read-only Application Programming Interface (API). This API accepts `GET` based [read] interactions. The response represents the most current information about the patient that is charted in Soarian Clinicals<sup>®</sup> at the time of the query. 

The search results include the following fields if they contain values:

* [Binary id](https://hl7.org/fhir/r4/resource-definitions.html#Resource.id){:target="_blank"}
* [Content type](https://hl7.org/fhir/r4/binary-definitions.html#Binary.contentType){:target="_blank"}
* [Content](https://hl7.org/fhir/r4/binary-definitions.html#Binary.data){:target="_blank"}
