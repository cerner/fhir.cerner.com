<p>The Diagnostic resources are concerned with the process of observing, testing, and diagnosing a patient. Note that, once a diagnosis is confirmed, it is recorded as a Condition so it becomes part of the historical patient record.</p>

<p>The DiagnosticReport resource typically provides a set of textual information and interpretation after performing a diagnostic service, such as a Radiology report or Pathology report.</p>
<p>The Observation resource primarily records discrete values, answers, and results, such as clinical laboratory data and vital signs.</p>
