        Please note that the <a href="#terminology-bindings">list in the terminology bindings section</a> is not the complete list mapped for our sandbox. Our sandbox has many codes, but we only document a few to provide an example. The list does not represent what would be mapped for one of our client’s domains. This is one of the things we evaluate and implement as needed when we are making apps available at client sites.
