- name: interpretation
  required: 'No'
  type: CodeableConcept
  description: >
    The assessment made based on the result of the observation. Intended as a simple compact code often placed adjacent

- name: component
  required: 'No'
  type: List of BackboneElement

    Some observations have multiple component observations. These component observations are expressed as separate code
    value pairs that share the same attributes. Examples include systolic and diastolic component observations for
    blood pressure measurement and multiple component observations for genetics observations.
