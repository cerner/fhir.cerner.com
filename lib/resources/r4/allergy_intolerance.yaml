                 This may be a code for a substance or pharmaceutical product that is considered to be responsible for
                 the adverse reaction risk (e.g., "Latex"), an allergy or intolerance condition (e.g., "Latex allergy"),
                 or a negated/excluded code for a specific substance or class (e.g., "No latex allergy") or a general or
                 categorical negated statement (e.g., "No known allergy", "No known drug allergies").
