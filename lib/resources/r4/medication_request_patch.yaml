      <ul>
        <li>
          Only the statuses of `stopped` and `cancelled` are supported.
          <ul>
            <li>The `stopped` status indicates the medication was stopped prior to all scheduled administrations occurring.</li>
            <li>The `cancelled` status indicates that the first instance was never administered.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          The `dosageInstruction.timing.repeat.boundsPeriod.start` field should be used to determine if the `stopped` or
          `cancelled` status is most appropriate. If the field is in the past, then the `stopped` status should
          be used, otherwise the `cancelled` status should be used.
        </li>
        <li>Using `stopped` when the `cancelled` status is most appropriate will result in the status being updated to `cancelled`.</li>
        <li>Using `cancelled` when the `stopped` status is most appropriate will result in the status being updated to `stopped`.</li>
      </ul>
